  <h1>Death on our streets: your tributes to homeless people who have died</h1>
  <h2>We asked you to share your memories and stories about people you have known who have died while homeless. Here are some of your responses</h2>
  <p>The Empty Doorway series from Guardian Cities and G2 launched in September in response to the horrific statistics on homelessness and homeless deaths in the UK. But we wanted to look behind the numbers, to paint a portrait of some of these people - piecing together details about their lives to commemorate them. We always knew, however, that there were many, many others, so we asked you to share your personal memories of people you knew who died homeless. The stories were incredibly moving. Some were about deeply loved friends or relatives, others about service users or strangers whom you struck up a relationship with, started to care and worry about, and whom you still often think of - years or even decades on. Many of you told us you felt you did everything you could think of to help but still worry there’s more you could have done. We’ve published some of your tributes here.</p>
